        <h1>Elastic</h1>

<p>Elastic makes your textareas grow and shrink to fit it’s content. It was inspired by the auto growing textareas on Facebook. The major difference between Elastic and it’s competitors is it’s weight.</p>

<h2>How to use Elastic</h2>

<p>The usage of Elastic is very straight forward. All you have to do is to include Jquery and the javascript file containing the plugin and use the elastic function.</p>

<div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nx">selector</span> <span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">elastic</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre>
</div>
